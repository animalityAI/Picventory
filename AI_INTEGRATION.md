# AI Integration in Picventory

Picventory uses artificial intelligence to analyze images of items and automatically identify, categorize, and catalog them into your inventory. This document explains how the AI integration works and how to customize it for your needs.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload images of items through the web interface.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized, normalized, and prepared for the AI model.
3. **Object Detection**: The AI identifies objects in the image.
4. **Classification**: Detected objects are classified into categories.
5. **Data Extraction**: The system extracts relevant information (name, category, etc.).
6. **Inventory Creation**: Items are automatically added to the user's inventory.

## AI Models Used

Picventory is designed to work with various object detection and classification models:

### Default Model

By default, Picventory includes a simplified implementation that demonstrates the flow but uses mock data. In a production environment, you would replace this with an actual AI model.

### Integrating with External Models

You can integrate Picventory with:

- **TensorFlow/PyTorch Models**: Pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.
- **Cloud Vision APIs**: Google Cloud Vision, Amazon Rekognition, Azure Computer Vision.
- **Custom Models**: Train your own models for specific inventory needs.

## Customizing the AI Integration

### 1. Replace the Mock Implementation

The core AI functionality is in `picventory/image_analysis.py`. Replace the `analyze_image` function with your own implementation that uses a real AI model:

```python
def analyze_image(image_path):
    """Analyze image and return detected items.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the uploaded image file
        
    Returns:
        List of dictionaries with detected items and their properties
    """
    # Load your AI model
    model = load_model('path/to/your/model')
    
    # Load and preprocess the image
    image = preprocess_image(image_path)
    
    # Run inference
    detections = model.predict(image)
    
    # Process results
    items = []
    for detection in detections:
        if detection['confidence'] > 0.7:  # Confidence threshold
            items.append({
                'name': detection['class_name'],
                'category': map_to_category(detection['class_name']),
                'description': f"Detected {detection['class_name']} in uploaded image",
                'quantity': estimate_quantity(detection),
                'confidence': detection['confidence']
            })
    
    return items
```

### 2. Model Storage

Place your trained models in the `picventory/models/` directory and reference them in your configuration.

### 3. Environment Configuration

Update your `.env` file with the appropriate model paths or API keys:

```
# AI model configuration
MODEL_PATH=models/detection_model.h5
CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_PATH=models/classification_model.h5

# Or for cloud services
GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Training Custom Models

For specialized inventory needs, you may want to train custom models:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather images of the specific items you need to identify.
2. **Label Data**: Label the images with bounding boxes and categories.
3. **Train Model**: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to train an object detection model.
4. **Export Model**: Export the trained model in a format compatible with Picventory.
5. **Integrate**: Update the `analyze_image` function to use your custom model.

## Performance Considerations

- **Image Size**: Large images require more processing power. Consider resizing before analysis.
- **Batch Processing**: For large uploads, implement a queue system with background processing.
- **Caching**: Cache AI results to avoid reprocessing identical or similar images.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Always provide a way for users to manually edit or correct AI results.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to the AI integration:

- **Multiple Item Detection**: Identify multiple items in a single image.
- **Barcode/QR Code Recognition**: Automatically scan and lookup product information.
- **OCR Integration**: Extract text information from packaging.
- **Condition Assessment**: Evaluate the condition of items (new, used, damaged).
- **Price Estimation**: Suggest market values for identified items.
